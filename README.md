Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting weekly sales data for retail stores using time series techniques. The dataset includes key features such as store identifiers, department numbers, weekly sales, temperature, fuel prices, unemployment rates, and holiday indicators.

Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand sales trends and seasonality.

Apply smoothing techniques like Rolling Mean and Exponential Smoothing to capture underlying sales patterns and reduce noise.

Forecast future sales using these models to assist business planning and inventory management.

Evaluate model performance using error metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.

Visualize actual vs. predicted sales for both training and testing periods to interpret model accuracy.

Tools & Techniques
Data processing and visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib.

Time series forecasting using Simple Exponential Smoothing from the statsmodels library.

Performance evaluation using standard regression error metrics.

Clear and insightful visualizations to communicate results effectively.
